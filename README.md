# Landing-page

<h3>Landing Page using HTML and CSS</h3>

This project was created to practice HTML and CSS basics.

I intend to keep updating this Landing Page as I study and practice these technologies.

I started by developing a static LP with at least four different sections and a fixed header.

Then, I worked to make the page responsive to every navigator resolution, to make mobile and desktop users have the same experience while navigating through the landing page.

I named the landing page company 'Lorem Ipsum' inspired by the website I was introduced while studying software development.

My focus as the time goes on is to add animations and different buttons and components behaviors.
